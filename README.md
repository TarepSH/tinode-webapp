# Single-page chat with Tinode

Single-page web chat application built with [Tinode](https://github.com/tinode/chat/). The app uses
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), Google's material design [fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts/)
and [icons](https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web). The [Tinode javascript library](https://github.com/tinode/tinode-js/) has no external dependencies. Overall it's a lot like open source WhatsApp or Telegram web apps.

Although the app is generally usable, keep in mind that this is work in progress. Some bugs probably exist. The app was tested in the latest Chrome & Firefox only. NPM [is available](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tinode-webapp).

Try possibly newer or older version live at https://api.tinode.co/. Login as one of `alice`, `bob`, `carol`, `dave`, `frank`. Password is `<login>123`, e.g. password for `alice` is `alice123`. You can discover other users by email or phone by prefixing them with `email:` or `tel:` respectively. Emails are `<login>@example.com`, e.g. `alice@example.com`, phones are `17025550001` through `17025550009`. The demo is reset every night at 2:15am Pacific time.
